# Weather-API
This is the Day 6 challenge
# Description
What was my motivation?
My motivation was learning how to build an API that shows me the weather. It helped me understand what API is and how to work on it javascript
Why did you build this project?
I built this project to understand APIs and local storage, which helped me learn from them and how to get and use API keys.
What problems does it solve?
The problem it opens is that you have to use the right API keys to get everything connected. You need local storage to get information, and if you don't have that, then your information is not being stored.
What did I learn?
I learned about APIs, local storage, and data reading as well.
What makes your project stand out?
My project stands out because it shows the past weather you used. It shows the back history you searched for after you moved to a new location. It then puts the data into buttons you can click on, showing you the data again if you need to look back.

# Installation
What I did was open git labs, and I made a git clone of the challenges I had to do into a separate folder, which I then made into my Challenges folder. 
After that, I went into my git hub, created repositories for my Web-API, and connected them with my challenges folder using git bash. I also created my assets folder there.
Then, I open the folder using Visual Studio code to make my index.html and style.css, and Javascript to use my project.
I used my git bash to commit my work and pushed each time I made something new in my Task-Board project. I also used weather API to get the key.
